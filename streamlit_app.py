# Explanation

    st.markdown("""
### üìä Data Source & Processing
All race data is manually collected from **Row2k.com Results**, and includes:
- **Date**
- **Boat Class**
- **Team Name (School)**
- **Position (Finish Order)**
- **Elapsed Time (in seconds)**

Not all NCAA Schools were included in this analysis. If a school was in a race but was not included in this analysis, they were simply skipped 
over in the race results.
The general inclusion criteria was to include all regattas of schools included in the analysis from march 21st onwards. 
That being said, it is possible I missed regattas of schools that are in this list. 

Each race is processed into **pairwise comparisons** (e.g., Team A beat Team B by 5 seconds), and all methods below rely on that foundation.

---

### ü•á Rank
For each date, a **Massey Rating** is calculated for all teams based on races **up to that point**.  
Teams are then **ranked from best to worst** by rating.

- Rank 1 = top team so far  
- If a team has not yet raced, Rank is **empty**

---

### üìà Percentile
Percentile is a **rescaled version of rank**, expressed as a score from 0 to 100:
- 100 = top-ranked team  
- 50 = middle of the pack  
- 0 = lowest-ranked team

This helps compare teams more intuitively, especially when field size changes.

---

### üß† Massey Rating
This is a continuous numeric score that reflects **how dominant a team has been**, factoring in:
- Who they raced
- Who they beat
- By how much

Massey ratings are **centered around 0**, with top teams rising above and underperformers falling below.

---

### üîÅ Rolling Ratings (New!)
Optionally, you can compute a team‚Äôs rating using only **recent races** from a moving window of days.

You can also choose how older results ‚Äúfade out‚Äù:

- **Sudden**: All races within the window have equal weight; older ones drop off immediately.
- **Linear**: Races lose influence gradually as they age within the window.
- **Exponential Decay**: Older races decline quickly in influence, controlled by a **decay rate**.

Rolling ratings are helpful for tracking **momentum** and avoiding outdated performance bias.
